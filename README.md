# HKC Securewave Series (on Roblox)
Created by TaylorGaming2019


The first ever HKC system that exists on Roblox, based off the Ae Surge system but it's heavily modified. 

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works?
The system works off the back-bone of the Ae Surge but consists of tad modifications to the KPB script, where it'll play the keypad voices (etc.). These modifications were made to make the system look as realistic as possible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What systems are made/working?
So far, we have 3 systems working; these are known as HKC Securewave (the flappy keypad), HKC SW1070 Touch Keypad and the HKC Quantum.

## üìù How was it made possible?
With the help of meshing/modelling together the components of a HKC system using a 3D CAD software and uploading them to ROBLOX (and making the neccessary aesthetic changes), they have been spec'ed to look as aesthetically realistic as possible.

## Formal Note
This is isn't in <b>ANY WAY</b> to impersonate the formal company HKC Security (https://www.hkcsecurity.com); logos, voices and other remained assets are not my property and belong to HKC.
